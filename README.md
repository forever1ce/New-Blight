Potato Plant Disease Detection App 🌱📱  


 Overview  
The Potato Plant Disease Detection App leverages deep learning (CNNs) to accurately classify potato leaves into three categories:  
✔️ Healthy  
⚠️ Early Blight  
❌ Late Blight  

This mobile application is designed to assist farmers and agricultural experts in identifying potential diseases early, reducing crop loss, and improving yield.
